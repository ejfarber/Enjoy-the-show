## About

Welcome! We love music, but music itself only appeals to one sense, sound. While traditional LED strips can create a pleasant atmosphere for listening, our reactive LEDs allow multiple senses to experience the track. Because the most advanced strips utilize a microphone, they have no efficient way to differentiate between external noise and the bass of the track. Our strip intelligently assigns different sections of the track to the respective LED segments without the need for a microphone, thus removing the existing limitations and enhancing the overall listening experience.
