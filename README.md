## About

Welcome! We are three roomates who love music, but hate how it only incorporates one sense - hearing. Existing LED strips can create an exciting atmosphere for listening, but are unable to differentiate between external noise and the parts of a track due to their reliance on a microphone. Our LED strips intelligently assign different sections of the song to their respective segments without the need for a microphone. This creates an exciting atmosphere for listening, and allows multiple senses to properly experience the track.
